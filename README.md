# Source Data 

* US Baby Names - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data

* Chicago Bulls 1998 Team Roster - https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1998.html  
# Tasks
- [ ] Choose dataset

* Intro - son

* Seems like there has been a lot of controversy about names in 2020. From the from the naming of the Coronavirus to most recently the name of Elon Musk's son.

I chose the US baby dataset to analyze and answer some questions.

* Name of Elon Musk's baby name with his girlfriend Grimes.

- [ ] Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.

* Looks like Elon Musk might be moving to Nevada or Texas. 
* What names will the parents consider? I think we can make a reasonable assumption.
The obvious one would be Ashley. However, what if the parents wanted to go with another name starting with A?

* Most popular name in the US

* If Musk chooses to give his son a nickname or a name that will fit on official documents, what are the most likely names?

* Be like Mike, did that name get popular?

* How about teammates

* Shaq
# What were the most popular US baby names during the last pandemic and what are the most popular names now?

* Want to close this post with a comparison of what names were most popular during the last pandemic and comparing 100 years later? Any names still in the top 10 per men or women? (look at last 10 years - 1910-1918 to 1920-)
* Spanish flu, Chinese Wuhan corona virus or COVID 19- naming controversy

* As we are cacoonerd due to the pandemic, alot of us have been watching more Netflix and documentaries like the Last Dance. Since Michael Jordan and the Bull's, perhaps Mike and his teammates were having baby names aftered them? Is there any.

* Mike or Micheal

* 
What is Elon Musk's son's name - if its not just a publicity stunt? If he chooses a name that can be pronounced? What would be his choices - Link to Joe Rogan podcast


One of the many players trying to dethrone Mike was Shaquille O'neil. Many may have not known that Shaq and the Orlando magic did manage to beat Michael, Scottie and the bulls in 1995.

The last dance is a documentary. I heard recently that over a 1000 kid. Did we see an uptake in boy's named Michael? X, how about A or E?

1. What are the most popular names? Growth rate? 

If your lucky enough to be expecting a baby boy or girl? What are some up and coming names?

2. I was watchin this Shaw interview and the interviewer mentioned. So that got me thinking? I wonder how popular the name Michael
got.

* What baby name was the most popular? Has to be Michael? 

* What about their lastname? Maybe some Kids were named after the last name?

* One more NBA question, I saw this Shaq interview which was recommeed to me and he mentions over 1000 babies. Was he exaggerating? Let's take a look.

* The last comparable pandemic was the Spanish flu of 1918, what were the most popular names at that time vs what are the most popular baby names of today (well at least with the most recent data of 2018)
