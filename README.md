# udacity-data-scientist-nanodegree-project-1-write-a-data-science-blog-post
For this project, I have created a blog post and accompanying Github repository to add to my data science portfolio. 

# Blog post

# Setup

* You will authenticate with Google BigQuery using my service account key which I have provided (usually I would ask that you provide your own key, but want to make sure it "just works"" for you in this case)

* All you need to do is open up analysis.ipynb in jupyter notebook AFTER installing any dependencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt``

# Tasks

- [ ] Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
- [ ] Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
- [ ] Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- [ ] Evaluate your results.
- [ ] Share your insights with stakeholders.
- [ ] .gitignore credentials folder after project is marked so user will need to provide his/her own service account key and Google Cloud Platform project
