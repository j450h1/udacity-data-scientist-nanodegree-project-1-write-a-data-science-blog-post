For this project, I created a blog post on medium and this accompanying Github repository to add to my Data Science portfolio.

# Inspiration

As many of you, Iâ€™ve been watching the captivating documentary the [Last Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(TV_series)).

This inspired me to do this analysis on names like 'Mike', 'Michael' and other US baby names.
